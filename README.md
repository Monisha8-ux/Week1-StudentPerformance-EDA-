Project Title:- # Week1-StudentPerformance-EDA-
Project Overview:- This project is part of the NSP Nexus Internship Week 1 task. The goal is to analyze students' exam performance data and identify patterns that influence their academic outcomes. The dataset includes information on gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course. The analysis uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to discover trends and visualize relationships among these factors.
Learning Objectives:-
- Load and explore a real-world dataset using Pandas  
- Analyze relationships between categorical and numerical features  
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Derive data-driven insights from exploratory analysis  
- Present findings clearly and logically
Dataset Description:-
The dataset used is "Students Performance in Exams" from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

Key Features:
- gender: Male or Female  
- parental level of education: Highest education level of parent  
- lunch: Standard or free/reduced lunch type  
- test preparation course: Completed or not completed  
- math score, reading score, writing score: Exam scores for each subject
Tools and Libraries
- Google Colab – for coding  
- Python  
- Libraries: 
  - pandas → data handling  
  - matplotlib → basic plots  
  - seaborn → advanced visualizations  
- GitHub – project submission and version control
Key Insights:-
- Female students scored higher in reading and writing, while males performed slightly better in math.  
- Students who completed the test preparation course showed significantly higher scores.  
- Standard lunch students outperformed those on free/reduced lunch in all subjects.  
- Higher parental education levels correlated with better student performance.  
- Math scores had the widest distribution among all three subjects.
How to Run:-
- Clone this repository or download the notebook.  
- Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
- Upload the dataset (`StudentsPerformance.csv`).  
- Run all cells sequentially to view the analysis and results.
Conclusion
This EDA revealed that external factors such as lunch type, parental education, and test preparation significantly affect student exam performance. Such insights can help educators design better academic strategies and provide targeted support.
